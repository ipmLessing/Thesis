Schedules and Milestones

\newpage

\section{Perception Case Study: Drone Racing}

Present results from YOLOv8-based perception:

Compare accuracy between real-world and synthetic data (e.g., 75\% vs. 65\%).

Highlight the impact of Blender and Grounding DINO on model performance.


\section{SOH Management Case Study: EV Batteries}

Present Bi-LSTM results on SOH prediction accuracy:

Analyze degradation trends and energy optimization insights from your ICECI and CCNC papers.


\section{Proof-of-Concept Simulation for the RL Framework}

Simulate a simplified scenario where perception and SOH predictions are used to inform high-level decision-making.

Use existing datasets to demonstrate how the RL architecture could function in practice, focusing on:

Mode-switching behavior.

Trade-offs between performance and SOH metrics.
