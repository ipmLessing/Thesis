ABSTRACT = {This research addresses the challenges of visually impaired individuals’ independent travel by avoiding obstacles. The study proposes a distance estimation method for uncontrolled three-dimensional environments to aid navigation towards labeled target objects. Utilizing a monocular camera, the method captures cuboid objects (e.g., fences, pillars) for near-front distance estimation. A Field of View (FOV) model calculates the camera’s angle and arbitrary pitch relative to the target Point of Interest (POI) within the image. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s proficiency in detecting distances between objects and the source camera, employing the FOV and Point of View (POV) principles. The approach achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.18% and 6.24% on YOLOv4-tiny and YOLOv4, respectively, within 10 m. The distance model only contributes a maximum error of 4% due to POV simplification, affected by target object characteristics, height, and selected POV. The proposed distance estimation method shows promise in drone racing navigation, EV autopilot, and aiding visually impaired individuals. It offers valuable insights into dynamic 3D environment distance estimation, advancing computer vision and autonomous systems.},

ABSTRACT = {An essential part of a city's transportation infrastructure, taxis allow for regular encounters between drivers and customers. Nevertheless, there are issues with efficiency since there is an imbalance in the supply and demand for taxis. This study describes the creation of a platform that serves both customers and taxi drivers by offering immediate forecasts of demand and fare. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.31 and a negative log-likelihood of −3.84, the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) with the mixture density network (MDN) is employed to forecast taxi demand. The best RMSE of 3.24 is obtained for fare prediction via an ensemble learning model that integrates linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). To ensure peak performance, the models are systematically created, implemented, trained, and improved. By integrating these models into a web application interface, the taxi service system offers a better overall user experience, which improves urban mobility.},

ABSTRACT = {In the foreseeable future, electric vehicles (EVs) will play a key role in the decarbonization of transport systems. Replacing vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) with electric ones reduces the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) being released into the atmosphere on a daily basis. The Achilles heel of electrical transportation lies in the car battery management system (BMS) that brings challenges to lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery optimization in finding the trade-off between driving and battery health in both the long- and short-term use. In order to optimize the state-of-health (SOH) of the EV battery, this study focuses on a review of the common Li-ion battery aging process and behavior detection methods. To implement the driving behavior approaches, a study of the public dataset produced by real-world EVs is also provided. This research clarifies the specific battery aging process and factors brought on by EVs. According to the battery aging factors, the unclear meaning of driving behavior is also clarified in an understandable manner. This work concludes by highlighting some challenges to be researched in the future to encourage the industry in this area.},

ABSTRACT = {Computer vision is a new approach to navigation aiding that assists visually impaired people to travel independently. A deep learning-based solution implemented on a portable device that uses a monocular camera to capture public objects could be a low-cost and handy navigation aid. By recognizing public objects in the street and estimating their distance from the user, visually impaired people are able to avoid obstacles in the outdoor environment and walk safely. In this paper, we created a dataset of public objects in an uncontrolled environment for navigation aiding. The dataset contains three classes of objects which commonly exist on pavements in the city. It was verified that the dataset was of high quality for object detection and distance estimation, and was ultimately utilized as a navigation aid solution.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent success of machine learning has accelerated the development of data-driven lithium-ion battery state estimation and prediction. The lack of accessible battery operation data is one of the primary concerns with the data-driven approach. However, research on battery operation data augmentation is rare. When coping with data sparsity, one popular approach is to augment the dataset by producing synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion method for synthetic battery operation data generation. It combines a generative, adversarial, network-based generation module and a state-of-charge estimator. The generation module generates battery operation features, namely the voltage, current, and temperature. The features are then fed into the state-of-charge estimator, which calculates the relevant state of charge. The results of the evaluation reveal that our method can produce synthetic data with distributions similar to the actual dataset and performs well in downstream tasks.},
