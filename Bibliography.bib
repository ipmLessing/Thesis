   ABSTRACT   = {This research addresses the challenges of visually impaired individuals’ independent travel by avoiding obstacles. The study proposes a distance estimation method for uncontrolled three-dimensional environments to aid navigation towards labeled target objects. Utilizing a monocular camera, the method captures cuboid objects (e.g., fences, pillars) for near-front distance estimation. A Field of View (FOV) model calculates the camera’s angle and arbitrary pitch relative to the target Point of Interest (POI) within the image. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s proficiency in detecting distances between objects and the source camera, employing the FOV and Point of View (POV) principles. The approach achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.18% and 6.24% on YOLOv4-tiny and YOLOv4, respectively, within 10 m. The distance model only contributes a maximum error of 4% due to POV simplification, affected by target object characteristics, height, and selected POV. The proposed distance estimation method shows promise in drone racing navigation, EV autopilot, and aiding visually impaired individuals. It offers valuable insights into dynamic 3D environment distance estimation, advancing computer vision and autonomous systems.},

   ABSTRACT   = {An essential part of a city's transportation infrastructure, taxis allow for regular encounters between drivers and customers. Nevertheless, there are issues with efficiency since there is an imbalance in the supply and demand for taxis. This study describes the creation of a platform that serves both customers and taxi drivers by offering immediate forecasts of demand and fare. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.31 and a negative log-likelihood of −3.84, the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) with the mixture density network (MDN) is employed to forecast taxi demand. The best RMSE of 3.24 is obtained for fare prediction via an ensemble learning model that integrates linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). To ensure peak performance, the models are systematically created, implemented, trained, and improved. By integrating these models into a web application interface, the taxi service system offers a better overall user experience, which improves urban mobility.},

   ABSTRACT   = {In the foreseeable future, electric vehicles (EVs) will play a key role in the decarbonization of transport systems. Replacing vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) with electric ones reduces the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) being released into the atmosphere on a daily basis. The Achilles heel of electrical transportation lies in the car battery management system (BMS) that brings challenges to lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery optimization in finding the trade-off between driving and battery health in both the long- and short-term use. In order to optimize the state-of-health (SOH) of the EV battery, this study focuses on a review of the common Li-ion battery aging process and behavior detection methods. To implement the driving behavior approaches, a study of the public dataset produced by real-world EVs is also provided. This research clarifies the specific battery aging process and factors brought on by EVs. According to the battery aging factors, the unclear meaning of driving behavior is also clarified in an understandable manner. This work concludes by highlighting some challenges to be researched in the future to encourage the industry in this area.},

   ABSTRACT   = {Computer vision is a new approach to navigation aiding that assists visually impaired people to travel independently. A deep learning-based solution implemented on a portable device that uses a monocular camera to capture public objects could be a low-cost and handy navigation aid. By recognizing public objects in the street and estimating their distance from the user, visually impaired people are able to avoid obstacles in the outdoor environment and walk safely. In this paper, we created a dataset of public objects in an uncontrolled environment for navigation aiding. The dataset contains three classes of objects which commonly exist on pavements in the city. It was verified that the dataset was of high quality for object detection and distance estimation, and was ultimately utilized as a navigation aid solution.},

   ABSTRACT   = {The recent success of machine learning has accelerated the development of data-driven lithium-ion battery state estimation and prediction. The lack of accessible battery operation data is one of the primary concerns with the data-driven approach. However, research on battery operation data augmentation is rare. When coping with data sparsity, one popular approach is to augment the dataset by producing synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion method for synthetic battery operation data generation. It combines a generative, adversarial, network-based generation module and a state-of-charge estimator. The generation module generates battery operation features, namely the voltage, current, and temperature. The features are then fed into the state-of-charge estimator, which calculates the relevant state of charge. The results of the evaluation reveal that our method can produce synthetic data with distributions similar to the actual dataset and performs well in downstream tasks.},

   abstract = {Compared with other commonly used batteries, lithium-ion batteries are featured by high energy density, high power density, long service life and environmental friendliness and thus have found wide application in the area of consumer electronics. However, lithium-ion batteries for vehicles have high capacity and large serial-parallel numbers, which, coupled with such problems as safety, durability, uniformity and cost, imposes limitations on the wide application of lithium-ion batteries in the vehicle. The narrow area in which lithium-ion batteries operate with safety and reliability necessitates the effective control and management of battery management system. This present paper, through the analysis of literature and in combination with our practical experience, gives a brief introduction to the composition of the battery management system (BMS) and its key issues such as battery cell voltage measurement, battery states estimation, battery uniformity and equalization, battery fault diagnosis and so on, in the hope of providing some inspirations to the design and research of the battery management system. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Lithium-ion cells can unintentionally be exposed to temperatures outside manufacturers recommended limits without triggering a full thermal runaway event. The question addressed in this paper is: Are these cells still safe to use? In this study, externally applied compression has been employed to prevent lithium ion battery failure during such events. Commercially available cells with Nickel Cobalt Manganese (NCM) cathodes were exposed to temperatures at 80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C for 10 h, and electrochemically characterised before and after heating. The electrode stack structures were also examined using x-ray computed tomography (CT), and post-mortems were conducted to examine the electrode stack structure and surface changes. The results show that compression reduces capacity loss by −0.07\%, 4.95\% and 13.10\% respectively, measured immediately after the thermal testing. The uncompressed cells at 80 °C showed no swelling, whilst 90 °C and 100 °C showed significant swelling. The X-ray CT showed that the uncompressed cell at 100 °C suffered de-lamination at multiple locations after test, and precipitations were found on the electrode surface. The post-mortem results indicates the compressed cell at 100 °C was kept tightly packed, and the electrode surface was uniform. The conclusion is that externally applied compression reduces delamination due to gas generation during high temperature excursions.},

abstract = {The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has been extensively used in mobile communication and portable instruments due to its many advantages, such as high volumetric and gravimetric energy density and low self-discharge rate. In addition, it is the most promising candidate as the power source for (hybrid) electric vehicles and stationary energy storage. For these applications in durable equipment, the long-term cycling and storage behaviour becomes of increasing interest.

   abstract = {In this paper, functions of BMS in elections vehicles are explained. The BMS consists of number of electronics components for monitoring and controlling the functions of batteries in electrical vehicles (EVs). Nowadays, the EV has more concentrations because it has number of merits like compact in size, does not require fossil fuel so it is environment friendly, and cost-saving. The main components in EV are batteries because batteries decide the performance and efficiency of EV. So, we should give more importance to batteries. Battery is controlled and monitored with the help of BMS. The BMS protects the battery and increases life time and efficiency due to charging discharging process.},

Pure LiPF6 salt is thermally stable up to 107°C in a dry inert atmosphere, and its decomposition path is a simple dissociation producing lithium fluoride (LiF) as solid and PF5 as gaseous products. In the presence of water (300ppm) in the carrier gas, its decomposition onset temperature is lowered as a result of direct thermal reaction between LiPF6 and water vapor to form phosphorous oxyfluoride (POF3) and hydrofluoric acid (HF). No new products were observed in 1m solutions of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) by on-line TGA–FTIR analysis. The storage of the same solutions in sealed containers at 85°C for 300–420h did not produce any significant quantity of new products as well. In particular, no alkylflurophosphates were found in the solutions after storage at elevated temperature. In the absence of either an impurity like alcohol or cathode active material that may (or may not) act as a catalyst, there is no evidence of thermally induced reaction between LiPF6 and the prototypical Li-ion battery solvents EC, PC, DMC or EMC.}

abstract = {Partial electrification of vehicle drive trains, for example by the usage of 48 V systems, require high-power batteries with extreme robustness to temperatures, current rates and energy throughputs. In this study, the application-relevant lifetime performance of 33 state-of-the-art high-power lithium titanate oxide nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LTO|NMC) cells is measured under cyclic, calendar, and drive cyclic aging regimes. Regular extended check-ups reveal the cell performance in terms of capacity loss and internal resistance increase, which allows for the identification of critical operating conditions. For the first time a passive electrode effect is identified in calendar aging tests of LTO cells in which the cathode is geometrically and capacitively oversized. Passive electrode areas lead to a change in cell balancing, which can be illustrated by the shift of the half-cell voltage curves. Generally, the investigated cells show an excellent cycle stability for shallow cycles, even at high ambient temperatures and high current rates. Only large cycle depths greater than 70\% at elevated temperatures reduce the battery life significantly. Furthermore, the results show that cells cycled in areas of low state of charge age faster than in areas of high state of charge. The rise in internal resistance under calendar aging has the most detrimental influence on lifetime in a 48 V battery.}

This parameter refers to the impedance real-part at a defined frequency (0.1Hz). It is used to identify the battery RUL. The choice of this frequency is based on the analysis of the changes of the real-part plots with ageing. From these plots, we noticed that the greatest influence of the ageing is observed in the [0.1Hz, 1Hz] frequency range.}

abstract = {In the modern scenario of the automobile industry there is a translation from conventional fuel vehicles to electric vehicles as a set to reduce carbon percentage. High power Lithium-ion batteries are the main power source of this vehicle to drive the powertrain, but due to the natural influence of various hot environmental conditions, there is a significant reduction in mileage of vehicle which is not desirable because a lithium-ion battery pack covers 50 to 60\% whole cost of vehicle. To tackle this problem from recent years there are several types of research have been performed over active and passive thermal management techniques in which passive thermal management system is widely growth from recent years due to its numerous working advantages with the low-cost application. In the present study, we performed PCM based passive thermal management study over 60 Cell 18,650 Lithium-ion battery packs which are considered to be working for automobile applications. The high-power energy density battery is submerged with a layer of PCM to investigate the delay effect caused by the battery pack to resists the set limit of the threshold temperature range. The output field results from numerical investigation are predicted using neural network approach in which a multi-objective optimization strategy is proposed between battery pack delay effect for selected paraffin wax and RT-18 PCM against its given C-rate. furthermore, liquid fraction rate is monitored for the fixed temperature limit in varying C-rate condition, for optimization strategy Fixed temperature is taken as a function for time delay by PCM addition with liquid fraction rate of PCM over the varying C-rate condition. Correlations suggest paraffin wax is the best choice for a set temperature limit below 60 °C because paraffin wax is found to be melted faster and acts as a resistance to increase the temperature of the cell. The best fit line from the linear regression model using neural network approach suggest best fit line as the time delay is the function of liquid fraction rate over the selected PCM configuration. The highest time delay is occurred in case of paraffin wax PCM as 11,900 s for 1C rate and lowest time delay is occurred as 10,000 s for 1C rate in case of RT-18.}

   abstract = {Human drivers have different driving styles, experiences, and emotions due to unique driving characteristics, exhibiting their own driving behaviors and habits. Various research efforts have approached the problem of detecting abnormal human driver behavior with the aid of capturing and analyzing the face of driver and vehicle dynamics via image and video processing but the traditional methods are not capable of capturing complex temporal features of driving behaviors. However, with the advent of deep learning algorithms, a significant amount of research has also been conducted to predict and analyze driver's behavior or action related information using neural network algorithms. In this paper, we contribute to first classify and discuss Human Driver Inattentive Driving Behavior (HIDB) into two major categories, Driver Distraction (DD), Driver Fatigue (DF), or Drowsiness (DFD). Then we discuss the causes and effects of another human risky driving behavior called Aggressive Driving behavior (ADB). Aggressive driving Behavior (ADB) is a broad group of dangerous and aggressive driving styles that lead to severe accidents. Human abnormal driving behaviors DD, DFD, and ADB are affected by various factors including driver experience/inexperience of driving, age, and gender or illness. The study of the effects of these factors that may lead to deterioration in the driving skills and performance of a human driver is out of the scope of this paper. After describing the background of deep learning and its algorithms, we present an in-depth investigation of most recent deep learning-based systems, algorithms, and techniques for the detection of Distraction, Fatigue/Drowsiness, and Aggressiveness of a human driver. We attempt to achieve a comprehensive understanding of HIADB detection by presenting a detailed comparative analysis of all the recent techniques. Moreover, we highlight the fundamental requirements. Finally, we present and discuss some significant and essential open research challenges as future directions.},

   abstract = {Aggressive driving behavior (ADB) is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. The accurate recognition of ADB is the premise to timely and effectively conduct warning or intervention to the driver. There are some disadvantages, such as high miss rate and low accuracy, in the previous data-driven recognition methods of ADB, which are caused by the problems such as the improper processing of the dataset with imbalanced class distribution and one single classifier utilized. Aiming to deal with these disadvantages, an ensemble learning-based recognition method of ADB is proposed in this paper. First, the majority class in the dataset is grouped employing the self-organizing map (SOM) and then are combined with the minority class to construct multiple class balance datasets. Second, three deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), are employed to build the base classifiers for the class balance datasets. Finally, the ensemble classifiers are combined by the base classifiers according to 10 different rules, and then trained and verified using a multi-source naturalistic driving dataset acquired by the integrated experiment vehicle. The results suggest that in terms of the recognition of ADB, the ensemble learning method proposed in this research achieves better performance in accuracy, recall, and F1-score than the aforementioned typical deep learning methods. Among the ensemble classifiers, the one based on the LSTM and the Product Rule has the optimal performance, and the other one based on the LSTM and the Sum Rule has the suboptimal performance.},

This research analyzes the characteristics of old drivers' driving behaviors by utilizing the GPS trajectory data collected by the driving recorders installed in their vehicles. The analysis conducted was from the perspectives of route choice, driving time, driving distance, risky driving event, and driving speed. Furthermore, a linear regression model was used to explore the influence of drivers’ socioeconomic attributes and travel behaviors on driving speed. The results show that older drivers prefer short-distance travel in the daytime and tend to have more risky driving behaviors with aging.},

   abstract = {The occurrence of aggressive driving behavior is a random process among time-varying transversion. For modeling aggressive driving behavior, previous studies have typically relied on summative statistics (e.g. means and S.D.) as the inputs which fall short in extracting features of driving behaviors that are in a time-series pattern. The raw data are used to extract the pieces of the graph. Each graph represents a specific driving trip that includes driver characteristics, environment information, and driving behavior variables. Graphs of trips were constructed based on the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study data. 17 variables related to aggressive driving are extracted and converted into elements (pieces as described in the paper) in the construction graphs. Regression models are used for verifying the performance of using graph construction as the input in modeling. The result shows that a 5-sec time window is suitable for aggressive driving behavior modeling. 11 variables (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, lateral displacement, gender, age, distracted, drowsy, weather, horizontal alignment, time-to-collision) are selected for graph construction based on their significance. Both summative statistics and graph construction are applied. The result shows that graph construction achieves better performance over models based on summative statistic inputs (mean plus standard deviation, and mean only). Based on weights of variables, time-to-collision is found to be the factor which affects aggressive driving most. This method can be used in real-world applications to improve driving safety by alerting drivers of aggressive behavior identified in real time with Advanced Driver Assistance System applications.},

At present, there is no suitable method to identify dangerous driving vehicles accurately based on trajectory data. This paper aims to develop a detection algorithm for identifying dangerous driving behavior based on the road scene, which is mainly composed of imbalanced dangerous driver detection and labeling, extraction of driving behavior characteristics and the establishment of a recognition model about dangerous driving behavior. Firstly, this paper defines the risk index of the vehicle related to five types of dangerous driving behavior: dangerous following, lateral deviation, frequent acceleration and deceleration, frequent lane change, and forced insertion. Then, a variety of methods, including K-means clustering, local factor anomaly algorithm, isolation forest and OneClassSVM, are used to carry out anomaly detection on the risk indicators of drivers, and the optimal method is proposed to identify dangerous drivers. Then, the speed and acceleration of each vehicle are Fourier transformed to obtain the characteristics of the driver’s driving behavior. Finally, considering the imbalanced characteristic of the analyzed dataset with a very small proportion of dangerous drivers, this paper compares a variety of imbalanced classification algorithms to optimize the recognition performance of dangerous driving behavior. The results show that the OneClassSVM detection algorithm can be effectively applied to the identification of dangerous driving behavior. The improved Xgboost algorithm performs best for the extremely imbalanced data of dangerous drivers.},

In an effort to uncover to identify patterns in aggressive driving, we examine sensor data and video data of trips taken by drivers with ADHD and identify our distinct aggressive driving patterns. Using the sensor data, we extend our findings to all aggressive trips in our dataset and generate a model to detect aggressive driving patterns. By finding the similarity between trips and then using these distances to produce a KNN model, we are able to model our data and classify it into 4 driving patterns.

While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that can be applied to a variety of tasks. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1\% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014, which is remarkably close to the 34.2\% top-5 error achieved by a fully supervised CNN approach. We demonstrate that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions on a variety of tasks despite not being trained for them},

   abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

Scale specific and scale invariant design of detectors are compared by training them with different configurations of input data.

Based on this analysis, we propose to train and test detectors on the same scales of an image-pyramid. Since small and large objects are difficult to recognize at smaller and larger scales respectively, we present a novel training scheme called Scale Normalization for Image Pyramids (SNIP) which selectively back-propagates the gradients of object instances of different sizes as a function of the image scale.

   abstract = {The extraction and prediction of health indicators (HIs) are two vital aspects in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Aiming to estimate the RUL precisely, a novel integrated prediction method is proposed for LIBs on the basis of local tangent space alignment (LTSA) feature extraction and adaptive sliding window long short-term memory neural networks (ASW LSTM NN). In the proposed method, the indirect HI is first extracted by LTSA automatically to replace the unmeasurable capacity, and a strong correlation between them is verified by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Following that, with the extracted HI, an adaptive sliding window LSTM is constructed to conduct the RUL estimation of LIBs in routine environment. For the structured neural network, corresponding inputs are dynamically selected by the sliding window, while a varying length window mechanism is devised to update the window data along with the predicting cycle. Hence, the designed predicting method can learn the long-term dependencies by means of the inherent nature of LSTM and simultaneously capture the local fluctuations via the adaptive sliding window. Eventually, extensive experiments are conducted and corresponding results are compared with those obtained by existed approaches. The effectiveness of the integrated prediction method is validated, and our proposed model is proved to be more accurate in predicting the RUL compared with existed approaches.},

The capacity regeneration phenomenon and data noise are decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and then the SOH-related health indicators are deeply mined using incremental capacity analysis (ICA), and the peaks of IC curves and their corresponding voltages are extracted as the input of the model. Then, gated recurrent units (GRUs) are formed into a combined SOH estimation model by adaptive weighting factors. Finally, it is validated against the NASA lithium battery dataset. Experimental results show that the mean squared error (MSE) of the proposed combined model can reach about 0.3\%, and it has stronger generalization and prediction accuracy than other algorithms driven by independent estimation data.},

In this work, two types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are long short-term memory-RNN (LSTM-RNN) and gated recurrent unit-RNN (GRU-RNN), are proposed to estimate the surface temperature of 18650 Li-ion batteries during the discharging processes under different ambient temperatures. The datasets acquired from the Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) of NASA are used to train, validate and test the networks. In previous work, temperature has been set as the output of the networks; however, here the temperature difference along the time axis is adopted as the output. The net heat generated results in net temperature change, which is more closely aligned with electrochemical and thermodynamic laws. Extensive simulation results show that the two RNNs can achieve accurate real-time battery temperature estimation. The maximum absolute error in temperature estimation is approximately 0.75°C and the correlation coefficient between the estimated and measured temperature curves is greater than 0.95. The influences of three crucial parameters, which are the number of hidden neurons, initial learning rate and maximum number of iterations, are also assessed in terms of training time, root mean square error and mean absolute error.},

The road traffic accidents claim more than 1.2 million lives and cause as many as 50 million injuries each year without forgetting their huge impact on health and development. Several factors may result in the high number of accidents among which we can state the driving behavior. This paper focused on the study of drivers’ behavior and aimed to help reduce the number of accidents and consequently improve road safety. To this end, the driving behavior was classified into three categories (normal, drowsy and aggressive) based on smartphone sensors data. A new stacked Long Short-Term Memory (stacked LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks architecture was proposed for the driving behaviors classification. The accuracy of the obtained drivers’ states results was improved with the use of the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of belief functions that overcame the uncertainty of data. The obtained results are clearly better than those existing in other driving behavior classification studies since the obtained F1-measure score achieves 97\%.},

These applications use mobile sensors embedded in smart phones to recognize human activities in order to get a better understanding of human behavior. While progress has been made, human activity recognition remains a challenging task. This is partly due to the broad range of human activities as well as the rich variation in how a given activity can be performed. Using features that clearly separate between activities is crucial. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically extract discriminative features for activity recognition. Specifically, we develop a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which can capture local dependency and scale invariance of a signal as it has been shown in speech recognition and image recognition domains. In addition, a modified weight sharing technique, called partial weight sharing, is proposed and applied to accelerometer signals to get further improvements. The experimental results on three public datasets, Skoda (assembly line activities), Opportunity (activities in kitchen), Actitracker (jogging, walking, etc.), indicate that our novel CNN-based approach is practical and achieves higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods.},

To address the issue of hand-designed limitation for features, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework to automatically extract the features of driving behaviors. The mechanism behind our method is to model temporal features, capture salient structure features, and explore the correlation among the high-dimensional sensor data by fusing convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention unit. Moreover, a novel approach is introduced to build driving behavior dataset, which considers the effect of gravity in modeling smartphone sensor data. Subsequently, sensor data with device position independence is collected, and six types of driving events (straight driving, static, left turn, right turn, breaking, and acceleration) are annotated, which provides rich sensor information compared with other methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other competing methods significantly, which possesses good generalization ability in the identification of driving behaviors.},

In this paper, we propose a method to predict, from sensor data collected at a single turn, the identity of a driver out of a given set of individuals. We cast the problem in terms of time series classification, where our dataset contains sensor readings at one turn, repeated several times by multiple drivers. We build a classifier to find unique patterns in each individual's driving style, which are visible in the data even on such a short road segment. To test our approach, we analyze a new dataset collected by AUDI AG and Audi Electronics Venture, where a fleet of test vehicles was equipped with automotive data loggers storing all sensor readings on real roads. We show that turns are particularly well-suited for detecting variations across drivers, especially when compared to straightaways. We then focus on the 12 most frequently made turns in the dataset, which include rural, urban, highway on-ramps, and more, obtaining accurate identification results and learning useful insights about driver behavior in a variety of settings.},

However, it is still not clear how driving behaviors and energy consumption correlate with each other and to what extent these factors related to connected vehicles can influence the motion prediction performance. The precise recognition of driving behaviors and prediction of the vehicle motion is critical to the driving safety for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Hence, in this study, an energy-aware driving pattern analysis and motion prediction system are proposed for CAVs using a deep learning-based time-series modeling approach. First, energy-aware longitudinal acceleration and deceleration behaviors and lateral lane-change behaviors are statistically analyzed. Then, a sliding standard deviation (SSD) test is applied to evaluate the smoothness of the trajectory and velocity signals considering different energy consumption levels. An energy-aware personalized joint time-series modeling (PJTSM) approach based on a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) cell are proposed for accurate motion (trajectory and velocity) prediction of the leading vehicle. Finally, the differences in the prediction performance regarding different energy consumption levels are compared and discussed. It is shown that due to the higher randomness of the driving behaviors, the prediction accuracy for heavy energy users is the lowest among the three categories, which means it is harder to anticipate the driving behaviors of cars exhibiting heavy energy consumption. The personalized estimation of driving behaviors of CAVs will contribute to safer automated driving and transportation systems.},

A good representation of driving features can be highly valuable for autonomous driving, auto insurance, and many other application scenarios. However, traditional methods mainly rely on handcrafted features, which limit machine learning algorithms to achieve a better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning solution to this problem, which could be the first attempt of extending deep learning to driving behavior analysis based on GPS data. The proposed approach can effectively extract high level and interpretable features describing complex driving patterns. It also requires significantly less human experience and work. The power of the learned driving style representations are validated through the driver identification problem using a large real dataset.},

Deep learning techniques were used to extract latent features from the collected data. Extracted features were clustered into behaviors and used to create velocity profiles allowing an autonomous driving agent could drive in a human-like manner. By using proactive driving behaviors, the agent could limit potential sources of discomfort such as jerk and uncomfortable velocities. Additionally, we proposed a method to compare trajectories where not only the geometric similarity is considered, but also velocity, acceleration and jerk. Experimental results in a simulator implemented in ROS show that the autonomous agent built with the driving behaviors was capable of driving similarly to expert human drivers.},

Current research suggests that in-vehicle Controller Area Network-BUS (CAN-BUS) data can be used as an effective representation of driving behavior for recognizing different drivers. However, it is difficult to capture complex temporal features of driving behaviors in traditional methods. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework by fusing convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks with an attention mechanism, which is more suitable for time series CAN-BUS sensor data. The proposed method can automatically learn features of driving behaviors and model temporal features without professional knowledge in features modeling. Moreover, the method can capture salient structure features of high-dimensional sensor data and explore the correlations among multi-sensor data for rich feature representations of driving behaviors. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well in the real world driving behavior identification task, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

   abstract = {Road accidents occur at traffic signals, even though traffic patrolling and awareness are increased. Accidents occurred at traffic signal junctions are a significant proportion in the overall reported road accidents. Usually, when the drivers approaching the traffic signals, at the onset of yellow, the drivers would enter into a dilemma zone, where they will be in confusion mode assessing their capabilities to cross the intersection or stop. So, any improper decision might lead to a collision. To avoid right-angle crash, drivers apply harsh brake to stop before the traffic signals. But this may lead to back-end crash, when the following driver encounters the former’s sudden stopping decision. This situation gets multifaceted when the traffic is heterogeneous containing various types of vehicles. So, the main objective of this study is to assess the performance using machine learning techniques. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors’ (KNN) techniques are implemented to validate the classification of the driving behaviour in terms of safe stopping/unsafe stopping at the signalized junctions at the onset of the yellow signal.},

First, vehicle performance measures (speed, acceleration, brake pedal, gas pedal, steering angle, and lateral position) were collected through sensors. These measures were analyzed, and their correlation with drowsiness on different road segments was examined. The analysis was based on data obtained from a study that involved 22 subjects in the driving simulator located in the Traffic Research Center, Beijing University of Technology. Second, six classifiers were constructed for six curve segments, respectively, while only one classifier was constructed for all straight segments because the waveforms by subtracting the road curvature from the steering angle in the curve segments were different from the waveforms of the straight segments. Furthermore, the less the radius of curvature, the more the difference. Third, the performance of K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and artificial neural network classifiers were compared and evaluated. The experimental results illustrate that the support vector machine classifier achieved the fastest classification time and the highest accuracy (80.84\%). Support vector machine and artificial neural network are effective classification methods for detecting drowsy driving on different road segments.},

The behaviors are classified into the safe, the semi-aggressive, and the aggressive classes that are adopted with Driver Anger Scale (DAS) self-reported questionnaire results. The proposed system extracts four features from IMU sensors in the forms of time series. They are decomposed by DWT in two levels and their energies are sent to six ANFISs. Each ANFIS models the different perception about driving behavior under uncertain knowledge and returns the similarity or dissimilarity between driving behaviors. The results of these six ANFISs are combined by three different decision fusion approaches. Results show that Coiflet-2 is the most suitable mother wavelet for driving behavior analysis. In addition, the proposed system recognizes the overall driving behavior patterns with 92\% accuracy without necessity to evaluate the maneuvers one by one. We show that without longitude acceleration data, the driver behavior cannot be recognized successfully while the results do not disturb substantially when the gyroscope is not available.},

Therefore, this paper aims to propose a framework of driving behavior safety level classification and evaluation in real time, which was validated by a case study based on a driving simulation experiment. The proposed methodology focuses on finding the optimal number of safety “levels” or “zones” for driving behavior, classifying the safety levels with the help of different clustering techniques, and evaluating the driving safety levels based on developed classification models in real-time. Three clustering techniques were applied, including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering and model-based clustering. The optimal number of clusters was found to be four using k-means clustering, and the clusters of safety levels will be labelled as “normal” driving, “low risk” driving, “middle risk” driving and “high risk” driving. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a decision tree were thereafter developed as the classification model. The accuracy of the combination of model-based clusters and SVM models proved to be the best with four clusters, yet no significant difference to other models was found.},

Moreover, it is time-consuming to manually label huge amounts of driving data due to uncertainties of driver behavior and variances among the data analysts. To address this problem, a semisupervised approach, a semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM), is employed to classify drivers into aggressive and normal styles based on a few labeled data points. First, a few data clusters are selected and manually labeled using a k-means clustering method. Then, a specific differentiable surrogate of a loss function is developed, which makes it feasible to use standard optimization tools to solve the nonconvex optimization problem. One of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is then used to assign the optimal label to all of the training data. Finally, we compare the S3VM method with a support vector machine method for classifying driving styles from different amounts of labeled data. Experiments show that the S3VM method can improve the classification accuracy by about 10\% and reduce the labeling effort by using only a few labeled data clusters among huge amounts of unlabeled data.},

Developing precise driver behavior models near intersections can considerably reduce the number of accidents at road intersections. In this study, the problem of driver behavior modeling near a road intersection is investigated using support vector machines (SVMs) based on the hybrid-state system (HSS) framework. In the HSS framework, the decisions of the driver are represented as a discrete-state system and the vehicle dynamics are represented as a continuous-state system. The proposed modeling technique utilizes the continuous observations from the vehicle and estimates the driver's intention at each time step using a multi-class SVM approach. Statistical methods are used to extract features from continuous observations. This allows for the use of history in estimating the current state. The developed algorithm is trained and tested successfully using naturalistic driving data collected from a sensor-equipped vehicle operated in the streets of Columbus, OH and provided by the Ohio State University. The proposed framework shows a promising accuracy of above 97\% in estimating the driver's intention when approaching an intersection.},

Therefore, the behavior prediction that the driver should perform when the preceding vehicle braking is the key to improve the effectiveness of the warning system. This study was conducted to acquire characteristics in the car-following behavior when confronted by the braking of the preceding vehicle, including the reaction time and operation behavior, and establish a behavior prediction model. A driving experiment on the expressway was conducted using devices, such as millimeter-wave radars and controller area network (CAN) bus data, to acquire 845 segments of car following when the brake lamps of the car ahead are on. Data analysis demonstrates that the mean of time distance of car following, mean of car-following distance, and time-to-collision (TTC) mean are closely related with whether or not the driver slowed the car down. The operation states of the driver were divided into keeping the unchanged state of the degree of accelerator pedal opening, loosening of accelerator pedal without braking, braking, and other special situations with the input variables of car-following distance, speed of driver’s car, relative speed, time distance, and TTC using the support vector machine (SVM) method to build a prediction model for the operation behavior of the driver. The verification result showed that the model predicts driving behavior with an accuracy rate of 80\%. It reflects the actual decision-making process of the driver, especially the normal operation of the driver, to loosen the accelerator pedal without braking. This model can help to optimize the algorithm of the rear-end accident warning system and improve intelligent system acceptance.},

   abstract = {High-risk drivers are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents, and the driving risk level of drivers could be affected by many potential factors, such as demographics and personality traits. Based on the Structural Equation Model (SEM), this study involves a sample of 3150 drivers from the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP 2), to explore the relationships among drivers’ demographic characteristics (gender, age, and cumulative driving years), sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. More specifically, the mediation model of driver characteristics on risky driving behaviors moderated by gender is constructed by the SEM. The results show that the effects of driving experience on risky driving behaviors are partially mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for male drivers, while those are completely mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for female drivers. Moreover, the development trend of risky driving behavior engagements declines greater with the growing of driving experience for female drivers than male drivers. Finally, a classification model of the driver's driving risk is proposed by the Random Forest classifier, in which the driving risk level of the driver evaluated by the crash and near-crash rate could be classified through the driver's self-reported demographics, sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. The classification accuracy achieves up to 90 percent, which offers an alternative approach to identifying potential high-risk drivers to reduce property losses, injuries, and death caused by traffic accidents.},

   abstract = {The development of intelligent connected technology provides a platform for multidimensional information interaction and makes the recognition of a specific lane change strategy become a reality. Intelligent driving systems cannot make human-like decisions by only recognizing left or right lane change behaviors; in fact, poor environmental cognitive competence is the main cause of accidents of intelligent driving systems during road tests. Therefore, the recognition of specific lane change strategies can provide support for safety performance improvement. This research aims to identify the different lane change strategies of a subject vehicle with a rear approaching vehicle in the target lane. For the purpose of acquiring different strategies, a total of 42 experienced drivers including 37 males and 5 females participated in the on-road vehicle experiments, and we divided lane change strategies into three categories: mandatory, yielding, and waiting for lane change. The lane change duration time, lane crossing time, and characteristic parameters including distance to lane line, steering wheel angle, relative distance, and relative speed under different lane change strategies were compared and analyzed. Then the random forest classifier was employed to construct a lane change strategy identification model. Results indicated that the maximum value of global recognition accuracy under three input parameters reached 88.78\% when the time window was 1.2 s, which was higher than the maximum value of recognition accuracy under four input parameters, but the identification time was 0.1 s later than the model with four input parameters. In addition, the recognition performance of the random forest model, attention-bidirectional long short-term memory (Atten-BiLSTM) model and genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) model was compared. The results demonstrated that the global recognition accuracy and identification time of the proposed model were better than that of GA-SVM model under different input parameters, and the performance was comparable to the Atten-BiLSTM model. The findings provide the basis for the intelligent driving system to make more human-like decisions and improve safety performance.},

   abstract = {Background: Tailgating is a common aggressive driving behavior that has been identified as one of the leading causes of rear-end crashes. Previous studies have explored the behavior of tailgating drivers and have reported effective solutions to decrease the amount or prevalence of tailgating. This paper tries to fill the research gap by focusing on understanding highway tailgating scenarios and examining the leading vehicles’ reaction using existing naturalistic driving data. Method: A total of 1,255 tailgating events were identified by using the one-second time headway threshold criterion. Four types of reactions from the leading vehicles were identified, including changing lanes, slowing down, speeding up, and making no response. A Random Forests algorithm was employed in this study to predict the leading vehicle's reaction based on corresponding factors including driver, vehicle, and environmental variables. Results: The analysis of the tailgating scenarios and associated factors showed that male drivers were more frequently involved in tailgating events than female drivers and that tailgating was more prevalent under sunny weather and in daytime conditions. Changing lanes was the most prevalent reaction from the leading vehicle during tailgating, which accounted for more than half of the total events. The results of Random Forests showed that mean time headway, duration of tailgating, and minimum time headway were three main factors, which had the greatest impact on the leading vehicle drivers’ reaction. It was found that in 95\% of the events, leading vehicles would change lanes when being tailgated for two minutes or longer. Practical Applications: Results of this study can help to better understand the behavior and decision making of drivers. This understanding can be used in designing countermeasures or assistance systems to reduce tailgating behavior and related negative safety consequences.},

@article{Miyajima2007,
   abstract = {All drivers have habits behind the wheel. Different drivers vary in how they hit the gas and brake pedals, how they turn the steering wheel, and how much following distance they keep to follow a vehicle safely and comfortably. In this paper, we model such driving behaviors as car-following and pedal operation patterns. The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle. Experimental results show that the driver model based on the spectral features of pedal operation signals efficiently models driver individual differences and achieves an identification rate of 76.8\% for a field test with 276 drivers, resulting in a relative error reduction of 55\% over driver models that use raw pedal operation signals without spectral analysis © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Individual driver's driving behavior plays a pivotal role in personalized driver assistance systems. Gaussian mixture models (GMM) have been widely used to fit driving data, but unsuitable for capturing the data with a long-tailed distribution. Though the generalized GMM (GGMM) could overcome this fitting issue to some extent, it still cannot handle naturalistic data which is generally bounded. This paper presents a learning-based personalized driver model that can handle non-Gaussian and bounded naturalistic driving data. To this end, we develop a BGGMM-HMM framework to model driver behavior by integrating a hidden Markov model (HMM) in a bounded GGMM (BGGMM), which synthetically includes GMM and GGMM as special cases. Further, we design an associated iterative learning algorithm to estimate the model parameters. Naturalistic car-following driving data from eight drivers are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of BGGMM-HMM. Experimental results show that the personalized driver model of BGGMM-HMM that leverages the non-Gaussian and bounded support of driving data can improve model accuracy from 23$ \sim$30\% over traditional GMM-based models.},

   abstract = {Driver identification must be studied because of the development of telematics and Internet of Things applications. Many application services require an accurate account of a driver's identity; for example, usage-based insurance may require a remote collection of data regarding driving. Recently, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based behavioral modeling approach has been successfully developed for smartwatch-based driver authentication. This study extends the GMM-based behavioral modeling approach from driver authentication to open-set driver identification. Because the proposed approach can help for identifying illegal users, it is highly suitable for real-world conditions. According to a review of the relevant literature, this study proposed the first smartwatch-based driver identification system. This study proposed three open-set driver identification methods for different application domains. The result of this research provides a reference for designing driver identification systems. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, an experimental system that evaluates the performance of the driver identification method in simulated and real environments was proposed. The experimental results for the three proposed methods of driver identification illustrated an equal error rate (EER) of 11.19\%, 10.65\%, and 10.50\% under a simulated environment and an EER of 17.95\%, 17.07\%, and 16.66\% under a real environment.},

   abstract = {Abnormal driving of a driver often leads to some undesirable situations. To avoid such circumstances, this paper proposes a driver-adaptive system that can detect abnormality within one's own driving style. To achieve such a feat, firstly, a soft clustering approach is proposed to determine the driving style in three categories - aggressive, moderate, and protective. Then, it proposes an algorithm to analyze the driving profile and detect the variation of abnormality of the driver. Statistics of different vehicle kinetic characteristics, i.e., velocity, space and time headway, acceleration, jerk factor, etc., are considered for the clustering process. Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) is used to select the important features. Analyzing the results of different clustering algorithms such as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), FCM, and K-means, we used GMM in the proposed system for determining real-time driving style. The actual driving style is determined using the long-term driving history of the subject vehicle. Using GMM's soft clustering properties, the current deviation is measured by comparing the real-time driving style to the actual style. A learning factor is accommodated to update the actual style in every cycle so that the proposed system can adapt to the driver's skill-changing state. Real-life driving depends on real-time human decisions. Therefore, we have used the reconstructed NGSIM I-80 real-life traffic data to build and validate the proposed system.},

   abstract = {Recognition of abnormal driving behavior is an important application area as it can support driving reliability and improve safety. In the last decade, deep learning methods have been presented through fruitful academic research and industrial applications. State-of-the-art deep learning methods are not commonly used for detection of abnormal driving behavior based on driving parameter information, and are lacking in terms of recognition accuracy. Based on this, a novel data-driven abnormal driving behaviors method is proposed in this paper by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). In this process, real vehicle driving data, including the extreme acceleration and steering position, are analyzed to establish a dataset of driving behaviors recognition firstly. Then, the datasets are inputted into the CNN-BiGRU algorithm to recognize the abnormal driving behavior where CNN captures non-linear relations from long-term trends of sequences and BiGRU extracts features of time series from driving parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed method offers improved accuracy and robustness in recognizing abnormal driving compared with other existing machine learning methods.},
