\chapter{Acknowledgments}

This thesis template was started by MPU PhD student Ka-Hou Chan, under the request of Prof. Chan-Tong Lam,
to help compose the research proposal in \LaTeX{} for candidature confirmation, following the guidelines of the pedagogical office.
The template had since been evolved into a sophisticated version and remained stable for a year or so.

With the renaming from MPI to MPU, and also about to write his own PhD thesis, Ka-Hou Chan redesigned the cover pages and headings, with the new MPU logos incorporated.
Prof. Wei Ke turned the template into a \LaTeX{} class file, added the necessary commands and fine-tuned the structure.
