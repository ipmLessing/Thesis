\section{System Overview}

Provide an architectural diagram showing interactions between the perception module, SOH prediction module, and RL controller.


\section{Perception Module}

Detail how YOLOv8 and keypoint detection provide the RL controller with accurate positional data.

Discuss the role of Blender for synthetic data generation and how Grounding DINO supports few-shot learning for gate detection.


\section{SOH Prediction Module}

Explain the Bi-LSTM model for predicting battery SOH and how its outputs influence RL decision-making.

Include use cases from EV datasets to demonstrate SOH trends.


\section{RL Controller}

Describe the proposed RL controller design:

Hybrid reward structure balancing performance and SOH.

Mechanisms for mode-switching (e.g., toggling between performance optimization and SOH preservation).

Use a hypothetical case study to illustrate how the controller would handle conflicting objectives.
