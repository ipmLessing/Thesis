Problem Formulation

\newpage

\section{Multi-Objective Control Problem}

Define the task of optimizing both performance (e.g., speed, precision) and SOH preservation.

Introduce key components:

State Space: Perception outputs (gate positions, trajectories) and SOH metrics (degradation rates, energy use).

Action Space: Control commands (throttle, yaw, pitch) for drones or decision-making strategies for energy optimization.

Reward System: Hybrid reward balancing performance and SOH.


\section{Integration Challenges}

Discuss the complexity of integrating YOLOv8 perception, SOH predictions, and RL in a single framework.

Highlight trade-offs, such as prioritizing performance over SOH preservation in certain scenarios.
