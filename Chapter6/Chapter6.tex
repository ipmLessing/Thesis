\section{Perception Module Performance}

Discuss YOLOv8's strengths and limitations for gate detection in synthetic and real-world scenarios.


Analyze the effectiveness of Blender and Grounding DINO in addressing data limitations.


\section{SOH Prediction Module Performance}

Present Bi-LSTM accuracy metrics and their implications for SOH-aware decision-making.


\section{Insights from Conceptual RL Framework}

Analyze the theoretical trade-offs highlighted in the simulated RL framework:

Evaluate reward balancing and mode-switching outcomes.

Identify potential challenges for real-world implementation.


\section{Scalability and Generalization}

Discuss how the framework scales to different platforms or battery chemistries.

Highlight strategies for generalizing synthetic data findings to real-world applications.


\section{Ethical and Safety Considerations}

Reflect on safety mechanisms (e.g., fail-safes) and ethical issues in deploying the framework.
